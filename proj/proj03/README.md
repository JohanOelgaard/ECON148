# ECON148 Project 03
This is the repository for the third project in the course ECON 148 Data Science for Economists Spring 2024 at University of California Berkeley.

Ths assignment was to reproduce the analysis of a paper by Edward Miguel by translating the original papers code from Stata to Python. The paper is "Sell Low and Buy High: Arbitrage and Local Price Effects in Kenyan Markets" by Marshall Burke, Lauren Falcao Bergquist, Edward Miguel. The original paper can be found [here](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/ms29141.pdf).

The data used in the project can be found on the Harvad Dataverse [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/C8UMQP). We are using the 1.2 version of the data published on Apr 09, 2019. The necessary datasets are also included in the data folder of this repository, however the only difference between this and the 1.0 version published on Dec 23, 2018 is the addition of citation metadata.

The python code is written and run through a python 3.18 distribution and requires the following packages

- ```pandas (2.1.4)```
- ```numpy (1.26.4)```
- ```scipy (1.11.4)```
- ```statsmodels (0.14.0)```
- ```matplotlib (3.8.3)```
- ```stargazer (0.0.7)```

Be aware that if running a pandas version older than 2.1.0 the `.map` method will not work as intended and will need to be replaced with the now deprecated `.applymap`. This is the only known issue with when running the code on older versions.

Other than the README.md the repository contains the following folders and files:

- [data](/data): Contains all the datasets provided through the Harvard Dataverse. However the only datasets used in the code are
 - [baseline.dta](/data/baseline.dta)
 - [cleanpricedata_y1y2.dta](/data/cleanPriceData_Y1Y2.dta)
 - [ms1ms2_pooled.dta](/data/MS1MS2_pooled.dta)
- [figures](/figures): Contains the output figures generated by the code
